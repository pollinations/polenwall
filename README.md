## About

**pollenwall** is a little command line app which sets your wallpaper with incoming image generating pollens once they arrive from [pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai/c/Anything).

## Installation

After downloading, add it to an appropriate place in your file system which is included in your `PATH` variable and run `pollenwall` in command line.

If you wish you can navigate to the folder where `pollenwall` is and run it like the following `./pollenwall`.

If mac doesn't let you run the app please remove the extended attributes on the app.
`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <path-to-app>`

### Binary releases

Check the [releases page](https://github.com/pollinations/pollenwall/releases) to download `pollenwall`.

### Build from source

You need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to be installed on your system to build `pollenwall`.

For doing a debug build just run `cargo build` in repository root.
For doing a release build just run `cargo build --release` in repository root.

> I have only tested building on an arm based mac, if you have issues building or running on other platforms please create an issue and I'll test and add instructions.

If you're using a mac and want to cross compile to all supported platforms as well as build a universal binary for mac you may use [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make).

```bash
cargo install --force cargo-make
```

Setup your environment

```bash
cargo make install-targets
cargo make setup-cross-compilation-environment-mac-host
```

Build for all supported platforms

```bash
cargo make build
```

> For more granular control you may check `Makefile.toml`

Alternatively you may use [just](https://github.com/casey/just)

Setup your environment

```bash
just prepare-mac
```

Build for all supported platforms

```bash
just build
```

Outputs could be found in `target` folder.

## Usage

Just run the app, it is as simple as that.

Hint: Don't forget to try the attach mode! `pollenwall -a`

### Command Line Arguments

```
pollenwall [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

```
-a, --attach
        Attach to a random processing pollen until its evolution is done.

    --address <addr>
        You may give a custom address to pollinations ipfs node.

-c, --clean
        Remove images in "~/.pollenwall" directory.

    --generate-service <generate-service>
        Generates a service file depending on the platform and saves it to "~/.pollenwall"
        folder.

-h, --help
        Print help information

    --home <home>
        If "pollenwall" couldn't determine your home directory, to help it please run it with
        "--home <absolute-path-to-your-home-directory>"

-V, --version
        Print version information
```

### Running as a service

Currently only macos and linux is supported for this mode.

To run pollenwall in the background as a user service first generate the service with,

```bash
# With no arguments,
pollenwall --generate-service
# If you would like to give pollenwall arguments
pollenwall --generate-service="<space-separated-args>"
# Example (running in attach mode)
pollenwall --generate-service="-a"
```

You'll find the generated service located in `~/.pollenwall`

#### MacOS

To register the service to run at startup please paste this script to your terminal and run it,

```bash
cd ~/.pollenwall &&
# Copy to a location where systemd can see it
cp com.pollinations.pollenwall.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents &&
# Enable the service to run at startup
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pollinations.pollenwall.plist
```

To remove the service from startup please run,

```bash
# Disable service to run at startup
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pollinations.pollenwall.plist &&
# Remove the service
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pollinations.pollenwall.plist
```

While the service is running you may use these commands to control the service,

Start

```bash
launchctl start com.pollinations.pollenwall
```

Stop

```bash
launchctl stop com.pollinations.pollenwall
```

Restart

```bash
launchctl restart com.pollinations.pollenwall
```

Trace logs

```bash
tail -f ~/.pollenwall/com.pollinations.pollenwall.log
```

#### Linux

To register the service to run at startup please paste this script to your terminal and run it,

```bash
cd ~/.pollenwall &&
# Copy to a location where systemd can see it
sudo cp pollenwall.service /etc/systemd/user &&
# Enable the service to run at startup
systemctl --user enable pollenwall.service
```

To remove the service from startup please run,

```bash
# Disable service to run at startup
systemctl --user disable pollenwall.service &&
# Remove the service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/user/pollenwall.service
```

While the service is running you may use these commands to control the service,

Start

```bash
systemctl --user start pollenwall.service
```

Stop

```bash
systemctl --user stop pollenwall.service
```

Restart

```bash
systemctl --user restart pollenwall.service
```

Trace logs

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

## App Folder

App folder where `pollenwall` stores the pollens is located in your home directory with the name `.pollenwall`.

## Road Map

- [ ] Download other artifacts about a pollens (in progress)
- [ ] Give option to exclude or include different models in attach mode
- [x] Show the count of processing pollens in the app output
- [x] Make pollen storage volatile
- [x] Support Windows
- [x] Support Linux
- [x] Add attach to processing pollen mode
- [ ] Support video or `GIF` wall papers in supported platforms
- [ ] Add a run at startup option
- [ ] Publish to package managers for easy installation
