## About

**pollenwall** is a little command line app which sets your wallpaper with incoming [CLIP-Guided VQGAN](https://pollinations.ai/p/QmScDZ61x3AQbV6NJ9Wxb6VDTfprkPMRGyWM25iQ2xgFiA/create) pollens once they arrive from [pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai/c/Anything).

## Support

Currently `pollenwall` only supports x86 and ARM mac computers and x86 Windows computers.
Support will be expanded in very near future.

## Installation

After downloading, add it to an appropriate place in your file system which is included in your `PATH` variable and run `pollenwall` in command line.

If you wish you can navigate to the folder where `pollenwall` is and run it like the following `./pollenwall`.

If mac doesn't let you run the app please remove the extended attributes on the app.
`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <path-to-app>`

### Binary releases

Check the [releases page](https://github.com/pollinations/pollenwall/releases) to download `pollenwall`.

### Build from source

You need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to be installed on your system to build `pollenwall`.

For doing a debug build just run `cargo build` in repository root.
For doing a release build just run `cargo build --release` in repository root.

> I have only tested building on an arm based mac, if you have issues building or running on other platforms please create an issue and I'll test and add instructions.

If you're using a mac and want to cross compile to all supported platforms as well as build a universal binary for mac you may use [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make).

```bash
cargo install --force cargo-make
```

Setup your environment

```bash
cargo make install-targets
cargo make setup-cross-compilation-environment-mac-host
```

Build for all supported platforms

```bash
cargo make build
```

> For more granular control you may check `Makefile.toml`

Alternatively you may use [just](https://github.com/casey/just)

Setup your environment

```bash
just prepare-mac
```

Build for all supported platforms

```bash
just build
```

Outputs could be found in `target` folder.

## Usage

Just run the app, it is as simple as that.

### Command Line Arguments

```
pollenwall [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]
```

**Flags:**

```
-c, --clean      Remove pollens in "~/.pollen_wall" directory.

                        "--home <absolute-path-to-your-home-directory>"
```

## App Folder

App folder where `pollenwall` stores the pollens is located in your home directory with the name `.pollen_wall`.

## Road Map

- [ ] Download other artifacts about a done pollen
- [ ] Show processing pollens in the app output
- [x] Make pollen storage volatile
- [x] Support Windows
- [ ] Support Linux
- [ ] Give granular options about which wallpapers to set
- [ ] Support video or `GIF` wall papers in supported platforms
- [ ] Add a run at startup option
- [ ] Publish to package managers for easy installation
