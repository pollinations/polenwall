## About

**pollenwall** is a little command line app which sets your wallpaper with incoming [CLIP-Guided VQGAN](https://pollinations.ai/p/QmScDZ61x3AQbV6NJ9Wxb6VDTfprkPMRGyWM25iQ2xgFiA/create) pollens once they arrive from [pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai/c/Anything).

## Support

Currently `pollenwall` only supports x86 and ARM mac computers.
Support will be expanded in the near future.

## Installation

After downloading, add it to an appropriate place in your file system which is included in your `PATH` variable and run `pollenwall` in command line.

If you wish you can navigate to the folder where `pollenwall` is and run it like the following `./pollenwall`.
